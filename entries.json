By the time you get to this site, there will probably be some significant changes... or not. Who knows... I may end up completely forgetting about this site! :)</br></br>Regardless, whatever the future holds, my current plan is to use this site as a resume/portfolio site, and as I do different projects, I'd like to link to them here. Hopefully I can make this a nice dynamic page. Github kind of restricts what you can do, static pages only, but maybe with some Javscript trickery I can get you guys something really nice. Maybe even a few playable HTML games."},
