### Industries ###
Professionally, I currently work in the Leisure Travel space, creating website for major vacation suppliers. I work daily in the back-end, converting an old COBOL mainframe codebase to a modern Microsoft .NET technology stack. I typically work in the business logic of credit card processing, charter flight booking and availability, and our entire dynamic packaging engine in general.

As a hobby, I tinker around with robotics, IOT, and some web development.

### Technologies I use professionally, and as a hobby ###
Back-end Development:

* .NET (C#, VB)
* NodeJS

Front-end Development:

* ASP (Classic, .NET, .NET MVC)
* HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript
* Typescript (this is a recent addition, and I am fully in love)
* HUGO static site generator

Database Development:

* Microsoft TSQL

Communication:

* WCF Services
* REST Services

"Other" Technologies:

* RaspberryPi
* Arduino


### Current Hobby Interests ###
My current interest is my design for a Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Architecture to be used in a general purpose robot. It should be modular, expandable, and can inject newer technologies as they are developed over the next few years. It is a bit of a slow moving passion project, heavy on conceptual architecture and white boarding, and light on the actual "algorithm specifications"... mostly because, as an AGI, it needs to be so much more robust than a task specific Neural-Network (etc.) 

Additionally, some companies already have existing technologies that can be inserted into the architecture. Imagine an Amazon based NLP module, working together with a Azure based vision module. Don't reinvent the wheel, just incorporate the best of whats currently out there, and change it when something better comes along.

Modules I would like to incorporate are slots for: natural language processing (NLP), machine vision (my own thoughts), tactile sensor suite, physical body configuration and motion control, 3D Space modelling (my own thoughts), path planning, decision making.

And, my core knowledge representation is a variety of "Discrete Object"-to-"Concept"-relation based knowledge modeling, along with "Trust" probablilities. 

Two examples:
For the "Discrete object to Concept" idea as the robot might wanter around the world, instead of a 2D image from it's camera, categorized as an object as an Apple, calculate by quantity of red pixels or something... Think of trying to convert the 2D image to a 3D representation, and comparing it to a normalized 3D model representation of an apple.

The idea being, that the robot brain is based on 3D spacial data, rather than neural networks mapped to key-words. To create a 3d representation of the area around itself, based solely off vision, to pick out landmarks and plan navigation according to it's "internal" idea of what the world is. Humans do it every day... my goal is to get a robot to do it.

The second example, regarding a "Trust" based knowledge model, might be that the robot "reads" on wikipedia that apples are read, and reads on a message board that apples are green, and some troll on twitter tells it that apples are Nazi's... does that even make sense? Can an apple be a nazi? Has this specific source told me verifiable statements in the past? Have other trusted sources told me it was red? Who does it trust? 

The goal is to NOT become the next ["Tay"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot))
