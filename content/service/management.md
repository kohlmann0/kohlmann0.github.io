Whether you need a technical lead, or a project/personnel team lead, I've managed several small teams through out my career, both officially and unofficially.

I've been a direct customer contact, and a direct supplier contact. I've presented solutions to clients, and oversaw installations of million dollar robotic systems.

Preferred Project Tracking Systems:

* Team Foundation Server (professionally)
* Trello (free use)
* TrelloGantt (free use)
