### Mechanical Engineering ###
I have worked professionally and designed parts for most manufacturing technologies including milling, grinding, sheet metal forming, plastic and rubber molding, laser and water-jet cutting. 

Over the course of my career, I held the position of Mechanical Engineer, Manufacturing Engineer, Robotics Engineer, and my responsibilities have included everything from design and drafting, to machining and installation, to Continuous Improvement and Supply chain management.


### Certifications ###
* Certified SolidWorks Professional through CATI (2002), and continued to use SolidWorks daily up until 2015.
* Six-Sigma Green Belt certified through Huf North America around 2010, but haven't used it recently.


### Drafting and Modeling ###
I've been doing 3D drafting/modelling since 2001, and have used several different packages. Some are much better than others.

Preferred CAD software (professional):

* SolidWorks
* AutoCAD

Preferred CAD software (free for individuals and hobbyists):

* Fusion360


### Rapid Prototyping ###
I have the capabilities to do small 3D printed plastic parts in-house, with roughly a 4in x 4in x 4in max part size.

Steel, Aluminum, and larger plastic parts, I will outsource to local manufacturers in the Wisconsin area.

Some options for printed circuit boards are [PCBShopper](https://pcbshopper.com/), [Seeed Stuidos](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion.html), and [PCB:NG](https://www.pcbng.com/) (Note: I am not affiliated with any of these companies in any way, and get no commission... this is just a free tip, for those looking for something custom. They are well regarded in the maker community.)
