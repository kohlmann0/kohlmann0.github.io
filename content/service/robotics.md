### Mobile / Personal Robotics ###

Mobile robotics is my current major interest. I am actively seeking opportunities to work with individuals and companies building UAV, UGV, articulated humanoid, and driverless systems.


### Industrial Robotics ###

Custom industrial automation and robotics is where I started. Over 15 years, I've designed, installed, and programmed well over 20 custom automation systems. From small pick and place assembling units, to entire conveyor lines.
