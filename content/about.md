### Why the switch from mechanical engineering to software development? ###
The truth is, I'm a roboticist at heart, and I still love the mechanical side too, I'm quite good at it... but I wanted to get more involved in artificial intelligence, and for that I needed more programming experience. Mixing the mechanical side with the programming and controls side, is the direction I am headed. For now, I am quite happy learning all the new modern technologies. Cloud computing, Machine learning, Vision processing, Path planning and Obstacle avoidance... these are the next areas of interest to me. I'm not quite there yet, but am super excited to be "on the path".
