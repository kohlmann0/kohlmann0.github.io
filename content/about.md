Welcome! I'm currently a Software Developer based in the Milwauke, Wisconsin, USA area. My main focus these days is enterprise backend web development, for my employer [Trisept Solutions.](https://www.triseptsolutions.com/)

At previous positions, I worked as an Industrial Automation Engineer designing, installing and programming factory assembly lines and robots.
As a Mechanical Engineer, I designed custom components in steel, aluminum, and plastics to be machined, formed, molded, and welded.
As a Solidworks Instructor, I taught new users how to design components in 3D CAD software.

With all that experience in automation, you might ask how/why I switched to Web Development...
The truth is, I still love that side too, I'm quite good at it... but mixing the mechanical side with the programming and controls side, is the direction I am headed. For now, I am quite happy learning all the new technologies that are involved. Cloud computing, Machine learning, Vision processing, Path planning and Obstacle avoidance... these are the next areas of interest to me. I'm not quite there yet, but am super excited to get my foot in the door.
