### Software Developer ###
I am currently a Software Developer based out of Milwauke, Wisconsin, USA. My day-to-day development is in enterprise backend web development for [Trisept Solutions.](https://www.triseptsolutions.com/)

Previously, I worked as an Industrial Automation Engineer designing, installing and programming factory assembly lines, Programmable logic controllers (PLC's), and robots.

As a Mechanical Engineer, I designed one-off custom parts and prototypes in steel, aluminum, and plastics to be machined, formed, molded, and welded.

As a Solidworks Instructor, I taught new users how to design parts and assemblies in 3D drafting software.


### Why the switch from mechanical engineering to software development? ###
The truth is, I'm a roboticist at heart, and I still love the mechanical side too, I'm quite good at it... but I wanted to get more involved in artificial intelligence, and for that I needed more programming experience. Mixing the mechanical side with the programming and controls side, is the direction I am headed now. 

Cloud computing, Machine learning, Vision processing, Path planning and Obstacle avoidance... these are the next areas of interest to me. I'm not quite there yet, but am super excited to be "on the path".
