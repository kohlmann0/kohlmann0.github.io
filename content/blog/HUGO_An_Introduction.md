Hugo - An Introduction
===
Hugo is what is typically called a "Static Site Generator". Basically it takes a bunch of modular components and forms a single HTML file out of 5e reusable pieces.

If you are familiar with modern technology stacks like PHP, Java, or ASP.Net that build up an HTML document on the fly on the server side, think of a static site generator as something similar, except that it is pre-compiled at build time, and placed on the server as a complete HTML file.

Advantages

There are quite a few advantages to this. For starters, serving up individual HTML files is way faster than assembling it on the fly each time, server side. 

Secondly, because it is a static file, it tends to get a better SEO score (for various reasons which I am still looking into myself.)

Additionally reuse of code become much easier. So think about it like this... if you had a common component, like let's say your top navigation bar, that's on every page, if you made a change you'd have to make sure you update it on every page
