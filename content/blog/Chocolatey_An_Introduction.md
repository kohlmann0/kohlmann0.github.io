#Chocolatey

What is it, what does it do, and how can it help me as a developer?



###What it is

Chocolatey, despite its delicious sounding name, is actually not a sugary treat, but is one of the first package managers I've seen specifically for the Windows environment. If you are familiar with Linux, python, or Node.JS, you've probably used a package manager before, with commands like...

- apt-get install for certain brands of Linux

- pip install for python

- npm install for node.js

- nu-get for Visual Studio



For Windows, there hasn't really been much similar, until now.



###I've never used a package manager, what does it do!?

The short answer is that it's a decentralized repository for a variety of different programs. It usually involves running a single command line to find, download, instal, and configure a program. Or use it to update or completely uninstall a program already installed by Chocolatey.



###Okay... but, how does that help me?

Well, for one thing, it's got some great software in it. Things like Visual Studio code, Chrome and Firefox, Git, Node.Js. Pretty much anything people want to make available, and it's constantly growing.



Secondly, picture this. Because it's all command line, imagine running a script to install and configure an entire new machine. Or 20 new employee machines. Everything I listed above, plus an email client, Slack, VNC player, Putty, Curl, the whole works from one Power Shell script. Your IT guys needs to spin up 20 new identical development boxes? Chocolatey. Need to install some software on a server from a remote command line? Perfect. Picked up a nasty virus, and need to reinstall Windows from scratch, Chocolatey can get you back up and running fast when you're done.



###Awesome, I'm convinced! Let me at it!
